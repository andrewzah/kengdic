# Kengdic

Kengdic is a large, open Korean/English dictionary database created by Joe Speigle. It was originally hosted by Joe at ezkorean.com.

The bulk of the usable data is in `kengdic_2011.tsv`. The `raw` directory contains data which still needs to be examined. The `reports` directory contains information on issues discovered with the data (there are lots!).

Information may be incomplete, as we are still exploring and documenting the contents of this repository. Any contributions to information about this content would be much appreciated.

## Contributors

kengdic.tsv indicates sources by crediting Joe Spiegle, members of http://ezcorean.com nickname, and the author of engdic.

This data still needs a lot of work, and contributions are very welcome. Some ways you can help:

* Add English glosses or hanja to entries that are missing them
* Check existing entries for correctness (흰색 means white, not gray, "the m prophets", lowercase "british", etc.)
* Add new entries
* Assess the current coverage. Are we missing any particularly basic words, or words related to any specific subject?
* Fix grammatical, spelling or formatting issues
* Help come up with editorial and style guidelines.

By contributing data, you release it under the same license terms as Kengdic itself (see below).
